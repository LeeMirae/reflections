When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I work with other people on a big project, we need a common platform like GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I have an experimental version on my computer, in case of an automatic pull, the data might be lost?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork - basically a clone of other repositories done on the GitHub. Fork is a GitHub feature. Forking is good in case you want to modify someone's repository but that person still wants to keep the original version. 

Clone - copying a repository, can be implemented either locally or between a GitHub and a computer.

Branch - creating branches can only be done locally.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   You would know the state of the remote repository at the moment when you last pulled data. You would be able to compare this version with the one you might modify locally.  

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
